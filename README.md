# TensorFlow_Introduction
Here an overview of tensors, variables and placeholders are provided.

A tensor is a special type of mathematical object that was originally used to analyze
the way that materials stretch under tension.

Nowadays, a tensor typically refers to a multi-dimensional array.

To fully understand multi-dimensional arrays, we'll need to understand the concept of dimension.

The zero dimension is simply a point, or a single object.

The first dimension is a line, which can contain an infinite number of point elements. A one-dimensional array only requires one coordinate to locate an element.

The second dimension can be seen as a flat surface, which can contain and infinite number of lines. To locate an element in a two-dimensional array, you need to specify two coordinates.

The third dimension can be seen as a volume, which can contain an infinite number of surfaces. 

And the fourth dimension goes beyond what we can easily visualize, but can be seen as space time, or a volume that changes through time, something like that.

The following file "Multidimentional arrays.py" defines these arrays using TensorFlow.

The file "Variables.py" take a look at how TensorFlow handles variables.
